To leave the island, one must know their own eye color. There are no reflective surfaces on the island and no one can communicate with each other other than the leader of the residents. No one on the island knows how many of each eye color there is. Everyone on the island is a perfect logician, meaning that if there is a solution they’ll find it. Every morning the leader gives anyone a chance to leave the island by guessing their eye color. One morning, the leader gathers all 200 residents to make an announcement, he says “At least 1 person on this island has blue eyes” How many people leave the island and in how many days after the announcement? Notes: this is known as one of the hardest riddles ever.</p><p>Hit: The little child from “The Emperor’s New Clothes” story</p><h2 id="Small-Riddle"><a href="#Small-Riddle" class="headerlink" title="Small Riddle"></a>Small Riddle</h2><p><strong>Riddle:</strong> I am as light as a feather, yet no man can hold me for long. What am I?<br><strong>Answer</strong>: Your Breath.</p><p><strong>Riddle:</strong> Romeo and Juliet are found dead on the floor in a bedroom. When they were discovered, there were pieces of glass and some water on the floor. The only furniture in the room is a shelf and a bed. The house is in a remote location, away from everything except for the nearby railroad track. What caused the death of Romeo and Juliet?<br><strong>Answer</strong>: Romeo and Juliet are fish. The rumble of the train knocked the tank off the shelf, it broke and Romeo and Juliet did not survive.</p><p><strong>Riddle:</strong> What question can someone ask all day long, always get completely different answers, and yet all the answers could be correct?<br><strong>Answer</strong>: “What time is it?”</p><p><strong>Riddle:</strong> I’m as small as an ant, as big as a whale. I’ll approach like a breeze but can come like a gale. By some, I get hit, but all have shown fear. I’ll dance to the music, though I can’t hear. Of names, I have many, of names I have one.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p><em><strong>Machine learning</strong></em> is the study of algorithms that can learn from experience. In this book <sup id="fnref:1" class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote"><span class="hint--top hint--rounded" aria-label="[Dive into Deep Learning](https://d2l.ai/)">[1]</span></a></sup>, it will teach you the fundamentals of machine learning, focusing in particular on <em><strong>Deep learning</strong></em>.</p><h3 id="A-Motivating-Example"><a href="#A-Motivating-Example" class="headerlink" title="A Motivating Example"></a>A Motivating Example</h3><p>In the currently dominant approach to machine learning, we do not attempt to design a system explicitly how to map from inputs to outputs. Instead, we define a flexible program whose behavior is determined by a number of <em><strong>parameters</strong></em>. Then we use the dataset to determine the best possible parameter values, i.e., those that improve the performance of our program with respect to a chosen performance measure.</p><p>We can think of the parameters as knobs that we can turn, manipulating the behavior of the program. Once the parameters are fixed, we call the program a <em><strong>model</strong></em>. The set of all distinct programs (input–output mappings) that we can produce just by manipulating the parameters is called a <em><strong>family of models</strong></em>. And the “<em><strong>meta-program</strong></em>” that uses our dataset to choose the parameters is called a <em><strong>learning algorithm</strong></em>.</p><p>Before we can go ahead and engage the learning algorithm, we have to <strong>define the problem</strong> precisely, pinning down the exact nature of the <strong>inputs</strong> and <strong>outputs</strong>, and choosing an appropriate model family.</p><p>In machine learning, the <em><strong>learning</strong></em> is the process by which we discover the right setting of the knobs for coercing the desired behavior from our model. In other words, we <em><strong>train</strong></em> our model with data.</p><p><img src="/img/Training-Process.PNG"></p><p>Deep learning is just one among many popular methods for solving machine learning problems.</p><h3 id="Key-Components"><a href="#Key-Components" class="headerlink" title="Key Components"></a>Key Components</h3><ol><li>The <em><strong>data</strong></em> that we can learn from.</li><li>A <em><strong>model</strong></em> of how to transform the data.</li><li>An <em><strong>objective function</strong></em> that quantifies how well (or badly) the model is doing.</li><li>An <em><strong>algorithm</strong></em> to adjust the model’s parameters to optimize the objective function.</li></ol><h4 id="Data"><a href="#Data" class="headerlink" title="Data"></a>Data</h4><p>Generally, we are concerned with a collection of examples. They should follow <a href="/2024/04/03/Deep%20Learning%20Term/#Independently-and-identically-distributed-i-i-d"><em><strong>independently and identically distributed</strong></em></a>, (i.i.d). In order to work with data usefully, we typically need to come up with a suitable numerical representation. Each example (or <em><strong>data point</strong></em>, <em><strong>data instance</strong></em>, sample) typically consists of a set of attributes called <em><strong>features</strong></em> (sometimes called <em><strong>covariates</strong></em> or inputs)</p><p>When every example is characterized by the same number of numerical features, we say that the inputs are fixed-length vectors and we call the (constant) length of the vectors the <em><strong>dimensionality</strong></em> of the data. However, not all data can easily be represented as <em><strong>fixed-length</strong></em> vectors. </p><p>One major advantage of deep learning over traditional methods is that models can handle varying-length data. However, many of the most exciting models in deep learning do not work without large datasets. Some others might work in the small data regime, but are no better than traditional approaches.</p><p>Finally, it is not enough to have lots of data and to process it cleverly. We need the <em><strong>right data</strong></em>. One commonly occurring failure model concerns datasets where some groups of sample are unrepresented in the training data. Failure can also occur when the data does not only under-represent some groups but reflects societal prejudices. In other words, the model’s end result reflects our human being.</p><h4 id="Models"><a href="#Models" class="headerlink" title="Models"></a>Models</h4><p>By <em><strong>model</strong></em>, we denote the computational machinery for ingesting data of one type, and spitting out predictions of a possibly different type. In particular, we are interested in <em><strong>statistical models</strong></em> that can be estimated from data. Deep learning is differentiated from classical approaches principally by the set of powerful models that it focuses on. These models consist of many successive transformations of the data that are chained together top to bottom, thus the name <em><strong>deep learning</strong></em>.</p><h4 id="Objective-Functions"><a href="#Objective-Functions" class="headerlink" title="Objective Functions"></a>Objective Functions</h4><p>In order to develop a formal mathematical system of learning machines, we need to have formal measures of how good (or bad) our models are. In machine learning, and optimization more generally, we call these <em><strong>objective functions</strong></em>. By convention, we usually define objective functions so that lower is better. Therefore these functions are sometimes called <em><strong>loss functions</strong></em>.</p><p>When a model performs well on the training set but fails to generalize to unseen data, we say that it is <em><strong><a href="/2024/04/03/Deep%20Learning%20Term/#Overfitting">overfitting</a></strong></em> to the training data.</p><h4 id="Optimization-Algorithms"><a href="#Optimization-Algorithms" class="headerlink" title="Optimization Algorithms"></a>Optimization Algorithms</h4><p>Once we have got some data source and representation, a model, and a well-defined objective function, we need an algorithm capable of searching for the best possible parameters for minimizing the loss function. Popular optimization algorithms for deep learning are based on an approach called <em><strong>gradient descent.</strong></em></p><h3 id="Kinds-of-Machine-Learning-Problems"><a href="#Kinds-of-Machine-Learning-Problems" class="headerlink" title="Kinds of Machine Learning Problems"></a>Kinds of Machine Learning Problems</h3><h4 id="Supervised-Learning"><a href="#Supervised-Learning" class="headerlink" title="Supervised Learning"></a>Supervised Learning</h4><p>Supervised learning describes tasks where we are given a dataset containing both features and labels and asked to produce a model that predicts the labels when given input features. Each feature–label pair is called an example.</p><h5 id="Regression"><a href="#Regression" class="headerlink" title="Regression"></a>Regression</h5><h5 id="Classification"><a href="#Classification" class="headerlink" title="Classification"></a>Classification</h5><h2 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h2><section class="footnotes"><div class="footnote-list"><ol><li><span id="fn:1" class="footnote-text"><span><a href="https://d2l.ai/">Dive into Deep Learning</a><a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" class="footnote-backref"> ↩</a></span></span></li></ol></div></section>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="What-is-super"><a href="#What-is-super" class="headerlink" title="What is super"></a>What is super</h2><p>Super is a long-term investment designed to to help you for your retirement. For most working Australians,  it’s compulsory for your employer to make contributions to your super on your behalf - these are called <strong>Superannuation Guarantee</strong> (SG) contributions. It’s also a tax-effective way to save for retirement.</p><h3 id="How-to-choose"><a href="#How-to-choose" class="headerlink" title="How to choose"></a>How to choose</h3><p>You can generally choose which super fund you would like your SG contributions paid into. Check with your employer or visit <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/Individuals/Super">ATO website</a> for more information</p><h3 id="How-to-contribute"><a href="#How-to-contribute" class="headerlink" title="How to contribute"></a>How to contribute</h3><p>There are different types of super contributions, including employer contributions, personal contributions and government co-contributions (also called ‘super co-contributions’) Different types of contributions are taxed in different ways. There are caps on the amount you can contribute in a financial year. If you go over these caps you may have to pay extra tax</p><h4 id="Contributions-from-your-employer"><a href="#Contributions-from-your-employer" class="headerlink" title="Contributions from your employer"></a>Contributions from your employer</h4><p>Under current Superannuation Guarantee (SG) legislation, employers in Australia are generally required to contribute an amount to their employees’ super that’s equal to at least 10.5% of their wages or salary</p><p>SG contributions are usually taxed within the Fund at a rate of <strong>15%</strong> as they’re paid into your super account</p><h4 id="Contributions-from-yourself"><a href="#Contributions-from-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Contributions from yourself"></a>Contributions from yourself</h4><p>You can contribute more money to your super in several ways. The different types<br>of contributions generally fall into two categories: before-tax or after-tax</p><table><thead><tr><th></th><th>Before-tax contributions (also called concessional contributions)</th><th>After-tax contributions (also callednon-concessional contributions)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>What are they</td><td>Super contributions that have been made before your income tax has been calculated (up to the contribution cap of $27,500 a year), or, after-tax contributions for which you claim a tax deduction</td><td>Super contributions taken from your ‘take-home’ pay after income-tax has already been deducted (Up to the contributions cap of $110,000 a year, are tax-free)</td></tr><tr><td>When they’re taxed</td><td>Generally taxed at 15% when they’re received by your super fund</td><td>Generally not taxed when they’re received by your super fund</td></tr><tr><td>Examples</td><td>• Salary sacrifice contributions • Personal deductible contributions • Employer SG contributions</td><td>• Personal after-tax contributions • Spouse contributions</td></tr></tbody></table><h4 id="Government-co-contributions"><a href="#Government-co-contributions" class="headerlink" title="Government co-contributions"></a>Government co-contributions</h4><p>Government co-contributions (also known as ‘super co-contributions’) are designed to help people on lower incomes boost their super savings. To qualify, you need to make a personal<br>after-tax contribution to your super before the end of the financial year</p><p>Then, providing you meet the other eligibility requirements, the government will contribute an additional 0.50 to your super for every dollar of after-tax contribution you’ve made up to a maximum co-contribution amount of $500</p><h4 id="Spouse-contributions"><a href="#Spouse-contributions" class="headerlink" title="Spouse contributions"></a>Spouse contributions</h4><p>Your spouse may be able to make an after-tax contribution into your super account on your behalf, subject to eligibility requirements. Any spouse contributions made into your account count towards the non-concessional (after-tax) contribution cap.</p><p>Spouse contributions made on behalf of a low-income spouse may be eligible for a tax offset of up to $540. This is why spouse contributions are sometimes used by couples as a way to help reduce the tax they pay</p><h3 id="First-Home-Super-Saver-Scheme"><a href="#First-Home-Super-Saver-Scheme" class="headerlink" title="First Home Super Saver Scheme"></a>First Home Super Saver Scheme</h3><p>The First Home Super Saver Scheme (FHSS Scheme) is a government scheme intended to help first home buyers save money for their first home within their super fund. You can make personal deductible (before tax) and personal after-tax contributions into your super fund to save for your first home. You can then apply to release these personal contributions, along with associated earnings, to help you purchase your first home. You can apply to have a maximum of 15,000 of your personal after-tax contributions from any one financial year included in your eligible contributions to be released under the FHSS Scheme, up to a total of $50,000 contributions across all years. You’ll also receive the earnings on those contributions.</p><h2 id="Accessing-your-super"><a href="#Accessing-your-super" class="headerlink" title="Accessing your super"></a>Accessing your super</h2><h3 id="When-you-can-access-your-super"><a href="#When-you-can-access-your-super" class="headerlink" title="When you can access your super"></a>When you can access your super</h3><p>• You retire permanently from the workforce on or after reaching your preservation age<br>• You reach your preservation age and start a transition to retirement income stream<br>• You leave paid employment on or after reaching age 60<br>• You reach age 65 (even if you’re still working).</p><p>1 July 1964 or later the preservation age is 60</p><h3 id="If-you-leave-Australia"><a href="#If-you-leave-Australia" class="headerlink" title="If you leave Australia"></a>If you leave Australia</h3><p>If you’ve worked in Australia as a temporary resident, you may be able to claim your super under the government’s departing Australia superannuation payment scheme once you depart Australia. Your temporary visa must have expired (or have been cancelled), and you must have left Australia permanently (taxed at 35%). </p>]]></content>

You must understand what kind of trader you are.</p><h3 id="What’s-your-trading-style"><a href="#What’s-your-trading-style" class="headerlink" title="What’s your trading style?"></a>What’s your trading style?</h3><p>There are three types of trading styles.</p><h4 id="Casual-traders"><a href="#Casual-traders" class="headerlink" title="Casual traders"></a>Casual traders</h4><p>If you buy or sell shares once or twice a month (or even less), you’re a casual investor. You may want to avoid brokers that have an inactivity fee or charge higher broker fees for less frequent trades.</p><h4 id="Active-traders"><a href="#Active-traders" class="headerlink" title="Active traders"></a>Active traders</h4><p>If you intend to buy and sell shares multiple times in a day, you’re an active trader. You’d want to look for platforms that offer low brokerage for high-frequency trading and an extensive range of trading features, such as charting tools and order options</p><h4 id="Long-term-investors"><a href="#Long-term-investors" class="headerlink" title="Long-term investors"></a>Long-term investors</h4><p>Investors use the “buy and hold” strategy by targeting quality companies they think will rise over a long time frame and possibly offer dividends. They may only buy and sell a few times in a year. Investors may find the inactivity fee more important than a stock analysis feature.</p><h3 id="How-to-compare-online-brokers"><a href="#How-to-compare-online-brokers" class="headerlink" title="How to compare online brokers"></a>How to compare online brokers</h3><p>Here are some of the key features to look at when comparing online share trading platforms:</p><ul><li><strong>The broker fees.</strong> Almost every online trading platform will charge you a brokerage fee (also called a <strong>commission fee</strong>) when you buy or sell shares, ranging from around $10 to $30 per trade. These fees may be calculated as a percentage of the transaction amount for larger trades and may also be lower depending on how frequently you trade.</li><li><strong>Monthly fees.</strong> Some providers charge ongoing subscription or inactivity fees where you’re charged if you make too few trades. This will especially be the case where a platform offers an extensive range of features for advanced traders.</li><li><strong>What can you trade?</strong> Some trading platforms will not only give you access to Australian shares but also international shares. Others will also allow you to trade currencies, indices and much more, so look for this functionality if it’s important to you.</li><li><strong>Ease of use.</strong> Share market trading can be complicated and often requires you to respond quickly to market changes. With this in mind, look for a platform that allows you to make fast and precise trades with minimum fuss.</li><li><strong>Access to market data.</strong> Does the platform offer dynamic, real-time or delayed market updates? Some platforms offer research and broker analysis on individual stocks that can come in handy.</li><li><strong>Order types.</strong> Consider the options available when you’re buying or selling shares.
